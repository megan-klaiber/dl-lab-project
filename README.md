# Installation notes

Download code from â€‹ https://github.com/florensacc/rllab-curriculum and then follow the instructions to compile the code as described in https://rllab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Install OpenAI's baseline algorithms as described in https://github.com/openai/baselines. Make sure to install it in the conda environment created in the rllab installation. Also make sure that python uses the OpenAI baselines when importing baselines and not the baselines from rllab.

In `baselines/baselines/ppo2/ppo2.py` add the line `env.set_model(model)` after line 125 (`for update in range(1, nupdates+1):`).
